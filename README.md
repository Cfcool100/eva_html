# eva_html 
this is an checkpoint of my course on html
in the index.html, we can find three sections, the head, the body and the footer of page.
in the head, we can find the relative element of page, for example the title.
in the body, we can see the div element, nav element with lists and sections with headings, paragraph, table, audio element and a form with labels, inputs, textarea and button.
